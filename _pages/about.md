I am a first-year PhD student at [GAIR Lab](https://plms.ai/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working with [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). I curated data and trained models — and in turn, data, models, and results also trained me.


Before that, I received my master's degree in Computer Science at the Nanjing University of Science & Technology advised by Prof. Rui Xia and Assoc. Prof. Jianfei Yu. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Wuhan Institute of Technology.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
